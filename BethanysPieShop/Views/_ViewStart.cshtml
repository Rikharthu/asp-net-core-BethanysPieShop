    // The _ViewStart file can be used to define common view code that you want 
    // to execute at the start of each View’s rendering. For example, 
    // we could write code within our _ViewStart.cshtml file to programmatically 
    // set the Layout property for each View to be the SiteLayout.cshtml file by default:

    // Specify the layout used by all Views (if not overridden in more specific ViewImports files)
    Layout = "_Layout";
